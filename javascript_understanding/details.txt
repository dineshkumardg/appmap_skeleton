The global environment and global object

code is run inside an execution context

global eexecution context creates two things for you
1. global object
2. this

Global means --> not inside a function

when you craete vars and functions that are not inside another functions, they get attached to the window object

hoisting:
--------

The variables and functions are available no matter where they are craeted inside a javascript file.

execution context is created and then executed:

when the program is run the vars and funcs are already there. 
all variables in javascript are initially created as undefined. during execution phase

setup memory space for variables and functions - hoisting.
-------------

declaring a variable without assigning anything makes it undefined. undefined is a special value that is set.

var a;
console.log(a) ----> undefined
a === undefined
